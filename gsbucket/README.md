# GS Bucket

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

This component deployms a new gsbucket using Terraform. It will return a HMAK keys for further `s3` like access.

At present this is a minimum viable gsbucket, possibly component will be extended in the future

## Implementation Details

The component has the following directory structure:

```text
./
├── hub-component.yaml       # Parameters definitions
└── main.tf                  # Terraform script
```
